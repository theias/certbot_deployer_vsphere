certbot_deployer_vsphere
===========

[Certbot Deployer] plugin for deploying "Machine SSL" web certificates via [Certbot] "deploy hook".

# Requires

* Python 3.9+
* vSphere 7 or 8

# Installation

You can install with [pip]:

```sh
python3 -m pip install certbot_deployer_vsphere
```

Or install from source:

```sh
git clone <url>
pip install certbot_deployer_vsphere
```

# Usage

## Examples

Examples assume the tool is being run as a Certbot deploy hook, and the environment variable `RENEWED_LINEAGE` points to the live certificate directory just updated by Certbot.

To deploy the certificate bundle indicated by `$RENEWED_LINEAGE` to `$VSPHEREHOST`:

```sh
certbot-deployer-vsphere --user $VSPHEREUSER --password $VSPHEREPASSWORD --host $VSPHEREHOST
```

## Config

It is recommended that you store the password in the Certbot Deployer configuration file (`/etc/certbot_deployer/certbot_deployer.conf`) with appropriate permissions rather than providing it as an argument and leaving it visible in the process list

```json
{
  [...],
  "vsphere": {
    "user": "vsphereuser",
    "password": "vspherepassword",
    "host": "vspherehost",
  }
}
```
